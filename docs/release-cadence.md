# Release Cadence

cf.gov will be on a two week release cadence that will line up with the platform teamâ€™s sprint schedule. The release process is as follows:

- For each release, a new branch is created from the current master, representing the next minor release, e.g. 5.1. 
- A new release is tagged from that branch with a 0 patch number, e.g. 5.1.0.
- That release is deployed to beta.
- If any fixes are necessary before going to production, they are committed to the release branch, and back-merged to master. New "hotfix" releases are tagged from the branch with the appropriate patch number as needed to get urgent changes onto beta.
- The latest release tagged on the release branch is deployed to www and content.
- If any urgent changes are needed before the next release is deployed to www and content, they are treated as hotfixes to the production release branch. Hot-fixes are committed to the release branch, and increment the patch number. For example, the first hotfix of 5.1 will be 5.1.1.

This is gh-pages repository for the manual to `cfgov-refresh`. Everything in this repository is 
automatically generated by mkdocs, so any changes should be made to the `docs` subdirectory
of the main `cfgov-refresh` project.

The way to update the manual is:

1. Create a branch for your updates.
2. Make a change in the `docs` directory of the `cfgov-refresh` repository.
3. Create a pull request from your branch to `master`.
4. Once your pull request is merged, checkout `master`, go to `docs`, and run `mkdocs gh-deploy --clean`.

This will generate the static site and automatically push it to the `gh-pages` branch.
